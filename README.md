## About the Project

BitGuard started out as a Bootcamp project where we were asked to build a simple JavaScript password generator. I also wanted to practice front-end skills,
so I decided to build something that I'd like to use on a day to day basis.

### More about Online Safety
Password theft is a serious problem. The websites and apps that you use are under attack every day. Security breaches occur and your passwords are stolen. When you reuse the same passwords everywhere hackers can easily access your email, bank, and other important accounts.

Security experts recommend that you use a different, randomly generated password for every online account that you create.
